This repository hosts Amoebas: discrete printed circuit boards for a single computer keyboard switch that facilitates the building of handwired mechanical keyboards.

## Amoeba Royale Encoder
As the name suggests, the Amoeba Royale Encoder builds on the Royale version of the Amoeba to allow its dual use for either MX compatible switches or rotary encoders.
Only the EC11 rotary encoder has been verified as working with this pcb.
